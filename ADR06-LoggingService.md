# Using Logging Service

The finished CMS should have a logging service which can track history of notable events in the system, this includes when complaints are created, complaints are assigned and also when they are resolved.
This should be highly considered for this CMS as it will be used by major organistations who will need to follow regulations and being able to track complaints will be massively important in ensuring that regulations are followed.
An example of this could be that, tenants accessing another tenants data, this would breach GDPR regulations. Therefore, having a logging service will help track complaints and ensuring they are acted upon common complaints.
